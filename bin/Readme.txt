The downloaded zip file contains the Sonnet source code 
and MS Visual Studio 2010 solutions. It also includes several examples.

Building SONNET
---------------------
To build SONNET, the sources of the used COIN libraries are also required.

Since the Cbc project has the same dependencies, you can download a Cbc source archive from
http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Cbc/

SONNET has been tested to work with Cbc 2.9.3 sources.
Extract the archive such that the Sonnet root directory is at the same level as Cbc, Clp etc.
